## What is Config layout?
Configuration layout describes how two-dimensional views are arranged in the dashboard and can be used for your customizations. When you save a custom layout configuration, you save the arrangement of the data in the dashboard.
In the configuration layout, you can select the module and submodule from the top and can add necessary fields to your form.
There are four subcategories in custom layout namely:- Form layout, Workflow, Settings, and Data visualizations.

#### To add a Field
* You can click on the **ADD FIELD** button to add a new field. After clicking on the button a form will appear where you can add the Name and type of the field.
