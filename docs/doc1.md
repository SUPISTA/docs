## What is User Designations?

On the user designations page, you can give a **hierarchy** to various designations of your company, as per your need. It follows an order **top to bottom** where the designation at the top (ie- Super User) has all the admin rights. The hierarchical structure forms like a tree, where the upper node acts as a parent to the lower nodes. Therefore, you can plan accordingly and provide different accesses to each designation at various levels.
