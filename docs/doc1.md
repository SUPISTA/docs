## What is User Designation?

On the user designation page, you can give a **hierarchy** to various designations of your company, as per your need. It follows an order **top to bottom** where the designation at the top (ie- Super User) has all the admin rights. The hierarchical structure forms like a tree, where the upper node acts as a parent to the lower nodes. Thus you can plan accordingly and can provide different access to each designation at various levels.
